For this workshop, I learned a bit more about memory allocation and got some more practice in with it (though I’m still no master at it by any means). My biggest challenge this time around other than struggling a smidge with writing parts of the functions due to me still being a little unfamiliar with c++ and the concept of references and pointers being used together, I struggled with getting the function append to read all 4989 lines within the sensorAnalysis.txt file. My function was only reading up till 50, and I initially thought maybe it was due to the CHUNK_SIZE being 50, but realized quickly that of course, it was due to my own logic flaw within the append function. After fixing the logic there of course, it ended up working just fine.
