	For this workshop, most of what I learned and just generally got to practice a lot of, revolved around overloaded operators that I quite frankly, had some trouble understanding initially. For example, I did not fully understand how operator bool() const was different from simply implementing and calling a bool return type function. After (a lot of) googling, I finally understood that a normal bool function can be compared to pressing a button asking if something is valid, while a operator bool() acts more like a motion sensor that just automatically detects if the object acts like a bool, and checks it without the need to call it like a function. 
	For the most part of the unary and binary member operators, I didn't have too much issue; however, the << and >> overloaded operators did stump me for awhile, and within the initial version of my code, I actually somehow managed to flip the logic for the two. I think because it also involved the use of *this, a newer concept paired with pointers, the logic threw me off a little (also the fact that using << and >> automatically moved funds from one side to another felt a little like weird magic). 
	In terms of the lab instructions itself, I couldn't help but notice the ChatGPT responses that were (maybe accidentally) pasted into the workshop instructions, and I couldn't help but wonder that if ChatGPT is the culprit for parts of the instructions sometimes sounding like vocabulary dumps when encountering newer concepts that I'm still trying to fully understand and grasp the concepts of. If ChatGPT is being used anyway for structuring the labs, I wonder if having tasks written in a point form list format will be more clear and efficient for students to read.
