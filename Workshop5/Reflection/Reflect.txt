	The biggest challenges for this workshop 80% stemmed from the fact that I had forgotten the existence of the course textbook and had to do a lot of learning outside of that about topics like utilizing the iomanip library to streamline some of the coding for the iostream functions. Something else that I initially had gotten a little confused about was the difference in parameters and the access levels for the different overloaded operators I had to implement. For example, I kept trying to access m_value or m_type when the overloaded operator I was implementing in the moment did not have direct access to the class' private members. The istream operator >> was definitely the most difficult one, a lot of googling was involved in trying to figure out how I could justify left and right (it was at this point that I had discovered the iomanip library). Had a good bit of trouble but that's mostly because I wasn't aware a fully implemented example for something similar was in the textbook that I could've taken a look at!
