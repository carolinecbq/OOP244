For Workshop 0, most parts went smoothly; however, I struggled a bit when it came to cloning the repositories. I got a little confused due to being on a Macbook and the repo instructions stating Windows instructions first, and then realizing after I've followed the Windows instructions that it did not fully apply to my Macbook. Another issue related the that, is the fact that I had only cloned the repository onto my matrix account, again, following the Windows instructions, so later when I was asked to use git pull after creating the xcode cpp file, I got very confused and did not understand why it wasn't working. Thankfully, it was finally resolved after I ended up deleting both cloned repos on the Matrix and on my Macbook, and started from scratch using the Apple instructions.
